# AKPsi Member Management Project Proposal


## Problem & Solution
Chapter attendance, absence approval, and member management are manually recorded on the excel sheet which is very unorganized and difficult to track. This is a very tedious process as the secretary has to manually mark each memberâ€™s attendance at every chapter-related event. A new web app will provide HR management-like tools, hoping to make the manual processes more automatic and painless process.
