# AKPsi Member Management Project Proposal


## Problem & Solution
Chapter attendance, absence approval, and member management are manually recorded on the excel sheet which is very unorganized and difficult to track. This is a very tedious process as the secretary has to manually mark each memberâ€™s attendance at every chapter-related event. A new web app will provide HR management-like tools, hoping to make the manual processes more automatic and painless process.

## User Interviews 
### On Choi (Former Secretary)
- How the system works
    * Go through the Absence request for the week and mark them on the attendance sheet before the chapter
    * Manually go through individuals who attended chapter and mark them on the attendance sheet
    * There is also no systematic process for getting a roster, especially the NIBS. Secretary will manually add them to the attendance sheet
- What challenges did you face while working as a secretary?
    * Last-minute requests
        - Usually on messenger or text
        - This is often overwhelming as 20+ messages will flood in
    * No point system
        - This is the ultimate decision-maker to decide member status
        - However, nobody knows about the point system
- What are the most important tasks you or other people need to perform as a secretary? 
    * Rush is the most important time as it is the biggest event everyone needs to be there

        - There was a web hub centralizing all relevant links. What happened to it??
- What took the most time while working as a secretary?
    * Checking the Absence request and manually responding to each person
